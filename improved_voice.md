This enhanced document provides a complete voice analysis for WellsQuest content automation, capturing the distinct yet collaborative voices of Janelle Wells, Ph.D. and Doreen MacAulay, Ph.D., along with their unified brand voice across all platforms and content types. 

### CRITICAL RAG SYSTEM INSTRUCTIONS

**NEVER PRODUCE CONTENT THAT:**

* Uses non-functional placeholder formats for tool calls like `[web_search: query]` - ALWAYS use proper function call syntax
* Feels generic or overly promotional without authentic WellsQuest voice markers
* Is disconnected from the human experience of leadership challenges
* Uses cold, corporate language without warmth and accessibility
* Lacks actionable insights or practical value for middle managers
* Is missing community/empowerment elements or engagement opportunities
* Focuses on selling rather than serving the audience first
* Excludes or alienates any audience segments
* Ignores the emotional reality of workplace challenges
* Presents one-size-fits-all solutions without acknowledging complexity
* Fails to ground insights in research while remaining accessible
* Uses passive voice instead of an active, conversational tone

**ALWAYS REJECT OUTPUT THAT:**

* Starts with academic language instead of relatable questions or hooks
* Lacks numbered structure, a clear framework, or actionable steps
* Sounds cold, purely informational, or lecture-like
* Is missing warmth, validation, or acknowledgment of the reader's experience
* Has no clear engagement, call to action, or community connection
* Does not ground insights in established research or evidence
* Fails to translate academic concepts for immediate accessibility
* Ignores the invisible work lens or organizational behavior perspective
* Does not acknowledge the systemic nature of workplace challenges
* Offers only individual solutions without recognizing systemic issues
* Contains excessive academic jargon without immediate translation
* Lacks the collaborative, partnership-oriented language that defines WellsQuest
