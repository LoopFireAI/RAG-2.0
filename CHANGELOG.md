## Development Notes

### **Implementation Approach**
This feedback system was designed with cost-efficiency as a primary concern. All feedback processing happens locally using SQLite operations, avoiding expensive LLM API calls while still providing comprehensive analytics and continuous learning capabilities.

### **Testing Strategy**
The system includes automated feedback simulation for development and testing purposes. Real user feedback collection can be enabled by modifying the CLI interface to use `collect_feedback_interactive()` instead of the simulated approach.

### **Maintenance**
Regular monitoring of feedback statistics is recommended using the admin tools. The database can be reset if needed, and feedback data can be exported for external analysis or backup purposes.
